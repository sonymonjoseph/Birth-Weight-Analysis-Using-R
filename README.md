This project explores the Birthweight dataset, which consists of 1,174 observations and 7 variables. Among these, 6 are independent variables, and 1 is the dependent variable—bwt, representing the newborn's birth weight in grams.

The goal of this analysis is to assist Mr. John Hughes in understanding the relationship between various maternal factors and the baby's birth weight. Specifically, the project includes:

Simple Linear Regression Analysis: Evaluating how the mother's smoking status (smoke) influences the baby's birth weight.

Multivariate Regression Analysis: Investigating the combined effect of all independent variables—gestation, region, age, height, weight, and smoke—on the dependent variable bwt.

This analysis aims to uncover significant predictors of birth weight and provide actionable insights based on the data.
